## YET ANOTHER CREEP SERVER

### This is a basic implementation of an HTTP server, created to write some code in Python.

Why Python? Well, it's a higher-level language compared to C/C++, which makes it easier and faster to write code.

### TODO
- Experiment with Unix Sockets
- Implement a thread handler for HTTP connections
- Incorporate more list comprehensions
